# olc-pgex-simple-bitmap-font
An extension for the OLC Pixel Game Engine that provides drawing routines for simple bitmap fonts with rudimentary kerning

	** Current key limitations:
	  - Early in development
	  - Will contain bugs and not optimised
	  - Only supports drawing decals (not sprites)
	  - No blank columns within a character in font atlas png
	  - Only basic error trapping
	  - Many more ..
